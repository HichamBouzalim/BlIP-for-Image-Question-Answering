# üñºÔ∏è Smart Image Descriptions using BLIP : Image Captioning with Hugging Face Transformers

A Python project that uses **BLIP** (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining) from Salesforce to generate **captions for images**. This project leverages Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch to produce high-quality image descriptions.

## üéØ Features

  - Generates descriptive captions for any input image.
  - Utilizes Salesforce‚Äôs BLIP model pre-trained on large-scale image-text datasets.
  - Easy-to-use interface with minimal setup.
  - Fully compatible with PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.

## ‚ö° Why BLIP?
- **Enhanced Understanding** ‚Äì Goes beyond object detection to interpret scenes, actions, and interactions  
- **Multimodal Learning** ‚Äì Closer to how humans perceive the world  
- **Accessibility** ‚Äì Generates descriptive captions for visually impaired users  
- **Content Creation** ‚Äì Assists in creating descriptive text automatically

## üöÄ Requirements
  - Python >= 3.11
  - PyTorch
  - torchvision (for image processing and model support)
  - Hugging Face Transformers
  - Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
  - Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive testing)

Optional: A GPU is recommended for faster caption generation.
